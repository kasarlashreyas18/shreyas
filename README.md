# Alarm-Based Irrigation System using Python

An **automated irrigation system** built with **Python** that triggers **alarms and water pumps** based on **soil moisture levels, temperature, or pre-set schedules**.  
This project helps conserve water and ensures crops are irrigated efficiently.

<details>
<summary>üìå Features</summary>

- Automated irrigation based on:
  - Soil moisture level  
  - Set time alarms (real-time clock)  
- Sends alerts or triggers alarms when soil is dry  
- Manual override option to turn ON/OFF irrigation  
- Logs irrigation history with timestamps  

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Requirements</summary>

- **Python 3.8+**  
- Libraries:
  - `time` (for alarms)
  - `datetime` (to manage irrigation schedule)
  - `RPi.GPIO` (if using Raspberry Pi for relay control)
  - `smtplib` or `twilio` (for optional email/SMS alerts)
- Hardware (Optional if real irrigation system):
  - Soil moisture sensor
  - Relay module
  - Water pump
  - Raspberry Pi / Arduino (for real-world deployment)

<details>
<summary>üíª Example Python Code</summary>

```python
import time
from datetime import datetime

# Set irrigation alarm (HH:MM format)
irrigation_alarm = "06:30"

while True:
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")
    
    if current_time == irrigation_alarm:
        print("üíß Irrigation Started!")
        # Code to activate water pump here
        time.sleep(60)  # Avoid multiple triggers in same minute
    
    time.sleep(1)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìä Future Improvements</summary>

* Integrate **IoT dashboard** for remote monitoring
* Add **weather API** to skip irrigation on rainy days
* Implement **SMS/Email notifications** for alarms
* Store logs in **database or cloud**

If you want, I can also **generate a sample Python script** that **simulates the alarm-based irrigation with logging** for your README example.

Do you want me to generate that Python script as well?
